## 2. Architecture Overview

Paradex uses a **hybrid model**:
- **Frontend**: User trading interface
- **Sequencer**: Off-chain orderbook, matches orders, submits to L2 for settlement
- **Starknet smart contracts**: On-chain custody, margin, liquidation, settlement
- **Bridge contract (L1 Ethereum)**: Move funds between Ethereum and Starknet

**Benefits**:  
- CEX-like UX and speed  
- True self-custody  
- Full transparency and auditability  
- No risk of sequencer theft (all assets secured by smart contract)

## 3. Trading Features

### Retail Price Improvement (RPI)
RPI orders guarantee that retail users get execution at equal or better prices than top CEXs (Binance, OKX, etc).  
**How it works:**
- When placing an RPI order, itâ€™s not matched immediately with the public book
- Professional market makers compete in a private auction to fill your order
- Fill only happens if price is *inside* the spread of reference CEXs
- No fill? Order expires, nothing is executed

**Advantages:**
- 0% taker fees
- Guaranteed no negative slippage
- Protected from MEV and front-running

**Limitations:**
- No guaranteed execution if no matching liquidity

### Perpetual Options
Paradex offers "perpetual options" â€” derivatives with:
- **No expiry**: Hold as long as you want
- **No liquidation**: Max loss is your paid premium
- **Implied leverage**: Small premium for large underlying exposure
- **Funding rate**: Instead of expiry, positions pay/earn funding (as with perps)

Perfect for speculation with limited risk or hedging.

### Order Types
- **Market order**: Immediate execution at best available price
- **Limit order**: Set your price, may not fill immediately
- **Stop loss / Take profit**: Conditional close orders
- **Reduce only**: Only closes/reduces your position, never reverses direction

### Trading Fees
- **RPI orders**: 0% fee
- **Maker**: -0.005% (youâ€™re paid to add liquidity)
- **Taker**: 0.03%
- **Liquidation**: Extra penalty applies

Fees are volume-based (30d rolling); XP points and token holdings can bring further discounts.

## 4. Risk & Liquidations

### Margin System
- **Cross-margin portfolio**: All positions share a single collateral pool; profits offset losses automatically.
- **Portfolio margin**: System considers correlations, netting risk across all positions for more efficient capital usage.
    - **Initial margin**: Required to open new positions
    - **Maintenance margin**: Required to keep positions open (drop below = liquidation)

### Mark Price
- Based on price indices from multiple CEXs (Binance, OKX, Bybit)
- Includes a funding basis component
- Formula: `Mark Price = Index Price + Funding Basis`
- Protects against manipulation, prevents unfair liquidations

### Liquidations
- Triggered when margin < maintenance margin
- Account is locked; no new orders or withdrawals
- Paradex liquidation engine takes over, closes positions orderly (via limit orders)
- Liquidation penalty goes to insurance fund

### Funding Mechanism
- Funding rate paid/received periodically between longs and shorts (typically hourly)
- Keeps perp prices anchored to spot
    - Positive rate: Longs pay shorts (perp > spot)
    - Negative: Shorts pay longs (perp < spot)
- Peer-to-peer; Paradex takes no cut

### Auto-Deleveraging (ADL)
- If insurance fund is depleted, profitable/highly-leveraged traders on the other side may have positions forcibly closed at bankruptcy price to cover losses.

## 6. Security & Trust

### Security Lockdown

- If your main key is compromised, youâ€™re notified and can use your Guardian Key to veto malicious actions during the window

### Guardian Keys

- Can only veto pending sensitive actions, not transact/trade

### Audits & Pentests

- Decentralized sequencer (removes last centralization point)
- Built for censorship resistance and high-frequency trading

### Starknet Ecosystem
- Wallets: Argent, Braavos (support account abstraction)
